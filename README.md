# terraform-aws-kops-ecr [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-ecr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-ecr)

Terraform module to provision an ECR repository and grant users and kubernetes nodes access to it.

## Overview

The module uses [terraform-aws-kops-metadata](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-metadata) to lookup resources within a Kops cluster for easier integration with Terraform.


## Usage

```hcl
module "cicd_user" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-system-user.git?ref=tags/0.3.0"
  namespace = "${var.namespace}"
  stage     = "${var.stage}"
  name      = "codefresh"

  tags = {
    Cluster = "${var.kops_cluster_name}"
  }
}

module "kops_ecr_app" {
  source       = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-ecr.git?ref=tags/0.1.0"
  namespace    = "${var.namespace}"
  stage        = "${var.stage}"
  name         = "app"
  cluster_name = "${var.kops_cluster_name}"

  users = [
    "${module.cicd_user.user_name}"
  ]

  tags = {
    Cluster = "${var.kops_cluster_name}"
  }
}

```
